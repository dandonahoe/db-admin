# NestJS API Application

This project is a NestJS-based API application that provides a robust and scalable server-side architecture.

The application is built using the NestJS framework, which offers a modular and extensible structure for developing server-side applications. It includes features for building, testing, and deploying a production-ready API.

- `src/api/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration
- `src/api/.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm (version 6.x or later)

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### Getting Started

To start the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can set the following variables:

- `PORT`: The port on which the application will listen (default: 3000)

### Testing

To run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Linting and Formatting

To lint the codebase:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To format the code:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled output will be in the `dist` directory.

To start the production build:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. Port already in use

Problem: When starting the application, you encounter an error message indicating that the port is already in use.

Error message:

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

Diagnostic steps:

1. Check if another instance of the application is running.
2. Verify if any other service is using port 3000.

Solution:

- Stop the conflicting process or change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm run start:dev
```

2. TypeScript compilation errors

Problem: Encountering TypeScript compilation errors during build or start.

Error message:

```
TS2307: Cannot find module '...' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

Diagnostic steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
2. Check if TypeScript definitions are missing for any packages.

Solution:

- Reinstall dependencies and TypeScript definitions:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

#### Debugging

To enable debug mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:debug
```

This will start the application in debug mode, allowing you to attach a debugger.

Log files are typically output to the console. To save logs to a file, you can redirect the output:

```bash
npm run start:dev > app.log 2>&1
```

#### Performance Optimization

To profile the application's performance:

1. Use Node.js built-in profiler:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--prof" npm run start:prod
```

1. Generate a processed log with:

```bash
node --prof-process isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log > processed.txt
```

Common bottlenecks:

- Database queries: Optimize by adding indexes or refactoring queries.
- Memory leaks: Use tools like `heapdump` to identify and fix memory issues.

## Data Flow

The request data flow in this NestJS application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

1. Client sends a request to the API endpoint.
2. The request is received by the NestJS server (main.ts).
3. NestJS routes the request to the appropriate controller (app.controller.ts).
4. The controller processes the request and calls the necessary service methods (app.service.ts).
5. The service performs business logic and data operations.
6. The result is returned back through the service to the controller.
7. The controller sends the response back to the client.

```
Client Request
     |
     v
NestJS Server (main.ts)
     |
     v
Controller (app.controller.ts)
     |
     v
Service (app.service.ts)
     |
     v
Controller (app.controller.ts)
     |
     v
Client Response
```

Note: This application uses dependency injection for loose coupling between components, allowing for easier testing and maintenance.
