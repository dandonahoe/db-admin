# Next.js Web Application Template

This project is a Next.js web application template that provides a starting point for building modern, server-side rendered React applications.

The template includes a basic landing page with Next.js branding and links to essential resources. It leverages Next.js features such as custom fonts, image optimization, and TypeScript support. The project structure follows Next.js conventions, making it easy to extend and customize for your specific needs.

Key features of this template include:
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- TypeScript support for enhanced type safety
- Custom font loading with next/font
- Optimized image handling with next/image
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- CSS modules for scoped styling

Key Files:
- `src/web/app/layout.tsx`: Main layout component for the application
- `src/web/app/page.tsx`: Landing page component
- `src/web/next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration file
- `src/web/package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
- `src/web/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the `src/web` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### Getting Started

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
```

### Linting

To run the linter, use:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Configuration

The `next.config.ts` file can be used to customize the Next.js configuration. Currently, it's set up with default options:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Add your custom configuration options within this file as needed.

### Common Use Cases

1. Adding a new page:
   Create a new `.tsx` file in the `src/web/app` directory. Next.js will automatically create a route based on the file name.

2. Customizing the layout:
   Edit the `src/web/app/layout.tsx` file to modify the global layout of your application.

3. Styling components:
   Use CSS modules by creating a `.module.css` file next to your component file, then import and use the styles in your component.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Module not found errors:
   - Problem: `Error: Cannot find module '...'`
   - Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in the `src/web` directory.
   - If the issue persists, check that the import path is correct and the file exists.

2. TypeScript errors:
   - Problem: TypeScript compilation errors during build or development
   - Solution: Run `npm run lint` to identify and fix TypeScript issues.
   - Review the `tsconfig.json` file to ensure TypeScript settings are correct for your project.

3. Next.js build failures:
   - Problem: `Error: Build failed because of webpack errors`
   - Solution: Check the console output for specific webpack errors.
   - Ensure all imported modules are available and correctly referenced.
   - Verify that all required environment variables are set.

Debugging:
- To enable verbose logging in Next.js, set the `DEBUG` environment variable:
  ```bash
  DEBUG=* npm run dev
  ```
- Next.js logs are typically output to the console where you run the development or build commands.
- For client-side debugging, use browser developer tools to inspect the React component tree and network requests.

Performance optimization:
- Use the `next/image` component for automatic image optimization.
- Implement code splitting by using dynamic imports: `import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'`.
- Monitor build output for large page sizes and optimize accordingly.
- Use the built-in Next.js performance analysis tool:
  ```bash
  ANALYZE=true npm run build
  ```

## Data Flow

The data flow in this Next.js application follows a server-side rendering (SSR) approach with client-side hydration.

1. Initial request:
   - The server receives a request for a page.
   - Next.js renders the appropriate page component on the server.
   - The server sends the pre-rendered HTML to the client.

2. Client-side hydration:
   - The browser loads the JavaScript bundle.
   - React hydrates the pre-rendered content, making it interactive.

3. Subsequent navigation:
   - Client-side routing takes over for faster page transitions.
   - New page components are loaded and rendered on the client.

```
[Server] --> (Initial HTML) --> [Browser]
    ^                               |
    |                               v
[Next.js API] <-- (Data Fetching) <-- [React Components]
    |                               ^
    v                               |
[Database/External APIs] ---------> |
```

Notes:
- Server-side rendering improves initial page load and SEO.
- Client-side navigation provides a smooth, app-like experience after the initial load.
- Data fetching can occur on the server or client, depending on the implementation.
